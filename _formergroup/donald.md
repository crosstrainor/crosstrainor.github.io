Donald Fasce (F&M '20) worked on analyzing the stellar content of galaxies that had previously only been detected in their Lyman-alpha emission in order to determine whether their Lyman-alpha emission was consistent with fluorescence from an external ionizing source. He analyzed images from HST/WFC3 in the F140W filter, performing aperture photometry to either detect their starlight or set a firm upper limit on this emission.

Don is now working in IT at a charter school in Rochester, NY while applying to graduate programs in astronomy.
