Conor Larison (F&M '20) analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies of extremely faint Lyman-alpha emitters at z=2.6 using images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Conor developed statistical measures of their asymmetry, multiple components, and disturbances. These measurements will be used to understand how the physics of Lyman-alpha escape is related to the spatial distribution of stars in forming galaxies. 

Conor is now a PhD student in Physics at Rutgers University.
