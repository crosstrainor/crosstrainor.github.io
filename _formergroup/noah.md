Noah Lamb (F&M '19) developed a series of Python scripts to stack broadband (stellar continuum) images and narrowband (Lyman-alpha) images of galaxies at z=2.6 and then fit their spatial profiles using symmetric models. He also developed a method to measure the empirical large-scale point-spread function of each image to use to fit the stacked galaxy images via a forward-modeling MCMC method. 

Noah is now a PhD student in Physics at Drexel University.
