Sandy Chilson (F&M '20) analyzed spectra of galaxies to determine their line-of-sight distance from an extremely bright quasar. She then searched for any trends in the spectroscopic properties of these galaxies (including their line emission and their inferred star-formation rates) to determine whether the central quasar was affecting their evolution.

Sandy is now teaching Physics and Geometry at the Barrie School near New York, NY.
