Hi! **I'm an Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA.**

My research is centered on the evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. In particular, I seek to understand
"feedback" in galaxy formation: how the lives and
deaths of stars shape the evolution of
galaxies. My work includes making measurements of
the production of elements in forming galaxies, the
explosions that accelerate gas and set the tempo of star-formation,
the escape of ionizing photons from galaxies, and the
effects of some of the brightest quasars (aka,
"active" black holes) on the gas and galaxies around
them. Exciting stuff!
      
How can a black hole be bright? What on Earth (or rather, *not* on
Earth) is a redshift? Find answers to these
questions (and more!) on my [Research](research) page!

I am also passionate about physics & astronomy teaching and outreach.
I always enjoy speaking
with students (and students-at-heart), so feel free to contact me using the links on the right side bar if you're looking
for a visitor for your school.

I am originally from California, and I previously completed degrees and fellowships at [UC Irvine](https://www.physics.uci.edu/), [Caltech](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/), and [UC Berkeley](http://astro.berkeley.edu/). Zot Zot! When I'm not teaching or doing research in galaxy formation, I like to spend time with my kids, watch [baseball](https://twitter.com/Dodgers) or [soccer/football](https://twitter.com/LiverpoolFC) games, [tweet](https://twitter.com/crosstrainor), and [take photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/148328039@N08/) (often these activities are combined).
