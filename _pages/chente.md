# Vicente ''Chente'' Brambila

Vicente Brambila (1998-2021) grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in May 2020 as a joint 
major in Dance and Government. As a student at F&M, Vicente was active in student groups such 
as Mi Gente Latina, IMPACT, and SAGA. He worked as a researcher with F&M's Global Barometer of 
Gay Rights, and he was known throughout campus for his award-winning dancing and choreography as
well as his activitism for justice. He is missed by many in both Pennsylvania and California.

I never taught Vicente in a class, but I had the privilege to see him perform many times, and we shared 
several conversations while he was enrolled in an astronomy class down the hall from my 
office called *A History of Space and Time*. We spoke and exchanged occasional emails about about astronomy, 
social justice, and understanding ourselves and our world through studying the past. 

# Dance as Justice, Past and Present

One of the last messages I exchanged with Vicente occurred after I sent him a congratulatory email on his 
graduation day. His reply to me included the following words:

*Your email inspires me to continue dancing! Dancing is my political message. Existing is political. Movement transforms the roots of action. Dancing is liberating. It is also ephemeral in its frame of movement. ❤️ *

Vicente often used dance to explore themes of justice. He was likewise interested in 
using dance to connect with his ancestors, particularly those indigenous people of modern-day Mexico whose stories had been
obscured by colonialism and time. One such dance---choreographed by Vicente and performed by himself and 
friends---occurred on el D\'ia de Los Muertos, November 1, 2019, and it left a particularly indelible mark on F&M's campus.
