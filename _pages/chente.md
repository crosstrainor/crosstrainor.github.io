Vicente ''Chente'' Brambila (1998-2021) grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in May 2020 as a joint 
major in Dance and Government. As a student at F&M, Vicente was active in student groups such 
as [Mi Gente Latina](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/mi-gente-latina), [IMPACT](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/i-m-p-a-c-t), and [SAGA](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/lgbta). He worked as a researcher with F&M's Global Barometer of 
Gay Rights, and he was known throughout campus for his award-winning dancing and choreography as
well as his activitism for justice. He is missed by his family in LA, by his partner Joshua, and 
by many other in both Pennsylvania and California.

# Dance and Justice

I had the privilege to see him perform many times, and we shared several conversations while he was enrolled in an 
astronomy class called *A History of Space and Time* that met down the hall from my office. We spoke and exchanged 
occasional emails about about astronomy, social justice, and understanding ourselves and our world through studying the past. 
One of the last messages I exchanged with Vicente occurred soon after his graduation in May 2021.
His reply to me included the following words:

*Your email inspires me to continue dancing! Dancing is my political message. Existing is political. Movement transforms the roots of action. Dancing is liberating. It is also ephemeral in its frame of movement.*

Vicente often used dance to explore themes of justice. He was likewise interested in 
using dance to connect with his ancestors, particularly those indigenous people of modern-day Mexico whose stories had been
obscured by colonialism and time. Several such dances performed and choreographed by Vicente used the image of the monarch 
butterfly (Spanish: *mariposa monarca*) to explore this theme.

# Mariposa: a Dance of Galaxies and Gas

Around the time that Vicente and I were discussing *A History of Space and Time*, I was studying a fascinating new galaxy our 
team had discovered. 
Initially designated Q1603-NB2500 and then Q1603-BLOB1, its name did not capture the exciting nature of the object: this was a galaxy with 
huge butterfly-like "wings" of illuminated hydrogen that extend well beyond the galaxy itself, clearly demonstrating the mysterious 
interactions between galaxies and their surrounding gas.

The interactions between galaxies and their gas is often called "feedback" because the growth of stars or supermassive black holes in the galaxy
produces complex effects that slow down future growth. These interactions play an important role in shaping the history of our own galaxy, and
they are often framed as a violent battle using words such as "strangulation" and "disruption". However, I have been inspired by [other astronomers](https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/intergalactic-pachamama-kichwa-cosmology-vs-western-astrophysics) to rethink my use of violent language to describe the Universe, especially with respect to the processes that brought our Galaxy into being. One of the questions Vicente and I discussed was *what would it mean to see our own cosmic history as a dance rather than a war?* 

After Vicente's death, many F&M community members and I were able to meet with his family and share our memories of his college years. In those
conversations, the Brambila family and I talked about the connections between Vicente's study of history and ancestry through the lens of 
dance and my own studies through the tools of astronomy. We decided that an appropriate way to honor his work and celebrate his life would be to name the unique galaxy described above *Mariposa* in memory of Vicente. The wing-like shape of Mariposa evokes Vicente's many dances with his Monarch 
butterfly wings, providing a reminder of the artistry he shared and of the power of dance to re-imagine our relationship to our 
ancestors--both on Earth and in the cosmos beyond. In this framing, the slow growth of galaxies through feedback interactions is not a 
matter of domination or death; perhaps it is more like the rhythm of a drum that keeps extragalactic evolution precisely on time.

# Vicente's Memory

If you would like to learn more about Vicente's legacy in Los Angeles and Lancaster, please see the following pages. Many of Vicente's 
friends and community members contributed to a [tribute page](https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/1Fg8RTXh), and the 
[Vicente Brambila Visual & Performing Arts (VAPA) Scholarship](https://www.amuanimo.org/studentscholarships) is now awarded to a student at 
a California Green Dot High School who intends to pursue an education in visual and performing arts after high school.

In the final year of his life, Vicente became very interested in the ecological protection of monarch butterfly habitats in 
Mexico, particularly after the deaths of the environmental activists Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández in early 2020. Please consider 
supporting these habitats, including the rights of their 
[long-term human inhabitants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X21000322).
