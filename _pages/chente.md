Vicente ''Chente'' Brambila (1998-2021) grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in May 2020 as a joint 
major in Dance and Government. As a student at F&M, Vicente was active in student groups such 
as [Mi Gente Latina](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/mi-gente-latina), [IMPACT](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/i-m-p-a-c-t), and [SAGA](https://www.fandm.edu/campus-life/clubs/lgbta). He worked as a researcher with F&M's Global Barometer of 
Gay Rights, and he was known throughout campus for his award-winning dancing and choreography as
well as his activitism for justice. He is missed by his family in LA, by his partner Joshua, and 
by many other in both Pennsylvania and California.

# Dance and Justice

I never taught Vicente in a class, but I had the privilege to see him perform many times, and we shared 
several conversations while he was enrolled in an astronomy class down the hall from my 
office called *A History of Space and Time*. We spoke and exchanged occasional emails about about astronomy, 
social justice, and understanding ourselves and our world through studying the past. 
One of the last messages I exchanged with Vicente occurred after I sent him a congratulatory email on his 
graduation day. His reply to me included the following words:

*Your email inspires me to continue dancing! Dancing is my political message. Existing is political. Movement transforms the roots of action. Dancing is liberating. It is also ephemeral in its frame of movement.*

Vicente often used dance to explore themes of justice. He was likewise interested in 
using dance to connect with his ancestors, particularly those indigenous people of modern-day Mexico whose stories had been
obscured by colonialism and time. Several such dances performed and choreographed by Vicente--including one on the D&iacute;a 
de Los Muertos in 2019---used the image of the monarch butterfly (Spanish: *mariposa monarca*) to explore this theme.

# Mariposa and the Dance of Cosmic History

Around the time that Vicente were discussing *A History of Space and Time*, I was studying a fascinating new galaxy our team had discovered. 
Initially designated Q1603-NB2500 and then Q1603-BLOB1, its name did not capture the exciting nature of the object: this was a galaxy with 
huge butterfly-like "wings" of illuminated hydrogen that extend well beyond the galaxy itself, clearly demonstrating the mysterious 
interactions between galaxies and their surrounding gas.

The interactions between galaxies and their gas is often called "feedback" because the growth of stars or supermassive black holes in the galaxy
produces complex effects that slow down future growth. These interactions play an important role in shaping the history of our own galaxy, and
they are often framed as a violent battle using words such as "strangulation" and "disruption". However, I was inspired by [other astronomers](https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/intergalactic-pachamama-kichwa-cosmology-vs-western-astrophysics) to be more thoughtful about the language 
I use to describe the Universe, especially with respect to the processes that brought our Galaxy into being. *What would it mean to frame our
own cosmic history as a dance rather than a war?* 

After Vicente's death, many F&M community members and I were able to meet with his family and share our memories of his college years. In those
conversations, the Brambila family and I talked about the connections between Vicente's study of history and ancestry through the lens of 
dance and my own studies through the tools of astronomy. We decided that naming this unique galaxy *Mariposa* in memory of Vicente would be
an appropriate way to honor his work and celebrate his life. The wing-like shape of Mariposa evokes Vicente's many dances with his Monarch 
butterfly wings, providing a reminder of the artistry he shared and of the power of dance to re-imagine our relationship to our ancestors 
both on Earth and in the cosmos beyond. In this framing, the slow growth of galaxies through feedback interactions is not an impediment; 
perhaps it is more like the rhythm of a drum that keeps extragalactic evolution precisely on time.

# Vicente's Memory

For more information on Vicente's legacy in Los Angeles and Lancaster, please see the following pages:

1. A [tribute page](https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/1Fg8RTXh) to Vicente from his community at F&M
2. The [Vicente Brambila Visual & Performing Arts (VAPA) Scholarship](https://www.amuanimo.org/studentscholarships) awarded to a student at a California Green Dot High School who intends to pursue an education in visual and performing arts after high school

In addition, in the final year of his life Vicente became very interested in the ecological protection of monarch butterfly habitats in 
Mexico, particularly after the deaths of the environmental activists Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández in early 2020. Please consider supporting
these habitats, including both their [butterfly and human long-term inhabitants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X21000322).
