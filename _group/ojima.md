Ojima Abraham (F&M Computer Science '23) took over a project begun by former students to stack broadband images of faint galaxies detected in Lyman-alpha and model their light profiles and sky background. As a computer science major, Ojima is focusing on improving the code to perform this stacking in order to make it more flexible and efficient for application to new galaxy samples.
